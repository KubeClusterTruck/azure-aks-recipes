### Quick Summary of AKS Cluster Deployment Pre-Requisites using new Advanced Networking

1. A **Service Principal** is required for all AKS deployments.  If your Azure Subscription/User Policies allow you to create a Service Principal, AKS will automatically create one for you if not specified.  However, most Azure Admin's will lock down this capability.  As a result, it is a best practice to first create an Azure AD Application and then create a new Service Principal associated to the Azure AD Application.  See the following documentation for a full description of the options & technical considerations - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal
2. Vnet/Subnet combination to be used with ASK needs to be pre-created in a **Resource Group** of your choice.  Make sure the Service Principal created in Step 1 has **Contributor** permissions in the target Resource Group.
