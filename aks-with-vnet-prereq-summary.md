### Quick Summary of AKS Cluster Deployment Pre-Requisites using new Advanced Networking

1. A **Service Principal** is required for all AKS deployments.  If your Azure Subscription/User Policies allow you to create a Service Principal, AKS will automatically create one for you if not specified.  However, most Azure Admin's will lock down this capability.  As a result, it is a best practice to first create an Azure AD Application and then create a new Service Principal associated to the Azure AD Application.  See the following documentation for a full description of the options & technical considerations - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal
2. **Vnet/Subnet** combination to be used with AKS needs to be pre-created in a **Resource Group** of your choice.  Make sure the Service Principal created in Step 1 has **Contributor** permissions in the target Resource Group.  Review the AKS Networking requirements and technical constraints to get an overview AKS networking architecture - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/networking-overview.  Next create the Vnet and AKS Subnet either via the Azure Portal or CLI (examples in the doco above).  Note that creating an AKS Cluster using **Advance Networking** features can only be deployed via the **Azure Portal** or with an **ARM template** at present.
